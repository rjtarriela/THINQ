ThinQ is an online pre-defined examination specialized assessment tool exclusively designed for Grade 10 
students. The pre-test is an introductory assessment that provides students with an overview of the topics 
they will be learning in Senior High School. This examination serves as a valuable tool in evaluating their 
interests, strengths, and knowledge level, aiding them in making informed decisions regarding their preferred 
Senior High School strand.

This project was created as a fun way to practice and enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It is a simple project, but I hope it can be helpful to others. Much of what I implemented was learned 
through online tutorials, including resources from YouTube and by using ChatGPT for logic-related questions, 
along with knowledge I had at the time. I applied some of its function in our capstone project when I was in
my last year in Diploma in Information Communication Technology. The project was created in 2023.
